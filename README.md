PSI-Blasting Homologies

Author: Keerthana Kumar

Given a file with seed sequences and other specifications you can generate a FASTA file with all unique results of PSI blast. Need NCBI's nr database and ~/.ncbirc pointing to the nr database for proper functionality. Requires at least ncbi-blast-2.2.28+ for psiblast functionality. Requires biopython for generating fasta file.

Look out to understand how this should be run for sample config.txt file.
